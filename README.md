# Dyedfox Radio

Desktop internet radio player for KDE Plasma, powered by [radio-browser.info](https://www.radio-browser.info/).

Inspired by [Shortwave](https://github.com/maunalinux/shortwave), with a native KDE look using PyQt6.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit |
| `Ctrl+W` | Minimize to tray |

## Install on Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
yay -S dyedfox-radio
```

Or manually:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/dyedfox-radio.git
cd dyedfox-radio
makepkg -si
```

## Build from source (PKGBUILD)

Clone the repository and build from its root directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dyedfox/dyedfox-radio.git
cd dyedfox-radio
makepkg -si
```

## Install on other Linux distros
(Debian 12+, Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dyedfox/dyedfox-radio.git && cd dyedfox-radio && bash install.sh
```

Requires Python 3.10+, GStreamer, `python3-dbus`, and `python3-gi` from your distro's package manager.

To upgrade, pull the latest changes and re-run the script.

If you already have the repository cloned locally:

```bash
cd dyedfox-radio
git pull
bash install.sh
```

Otherwise, clone it first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dyedfox/dyedfox-radio.git
cd dyedfox-radio
bash install.sh
```

To uninstall:

```bash
bash install.sh uninstall
```


## Manual installation

**1. Install dependencies** using your distro's package manager. You need:
- Python 3.10+
- PyQt6
- python-requests
- python-dbus
- python-gobject
- GStreamer + gst-plugins-base + gst-plugins-good

**2. Copy application files:**

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/dyedfox-radio/translations
sudo cp -r api data player tray ui assets main.py /usr/lib/dyedfox-radio/
sudo cp translations/*.qm /usr/lib/dyedfox-radio/translations/
sudo cp assets/icons/dyedfox-radio.png /usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/
sudo cp assets/icons/dyedfox-radio-tray.svg /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/
sudo cp dyedfox-radio.desktop /usr/share/applications/
```

**3. Create a launcher:**

```bash
echo -e '#!/bin/sh\nexec python3 /usr/lib/dyedfox-radio/main.py "$@"' | sudo tee /usr/bin/dyedfox-radio > /dev/null
sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/dyedfox-radio
```

## Known quirks

- **Bluetooth on cold start:** if you connect a Bluetooth device while playback is stopped, the next stream may start on your previous output — switch it in KDE's audio menu (tray → speaker icon) or simply restart the app. Streams already playing follow Bluetooth automatically. This is a side effect of defaulting to the PulseAudio output (`pulsesink`), which we prefer for reliable sound across distros that don't ship the native PipeWire GStreamer plugin.

## Localization

The UI language follows your system locale automatically.
